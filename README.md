# SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most widely used languages for querying relational databases. It is fairly simple to understand because it uses understandable words (like "SELECT", "FROM", "LIMIT", "JOIN") instead of code. It can be used with many different databases like MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite and others. The syntax may change slightly when using different databases. 

The projects listed here utilize MySQL or SQlite databases. Click on the link to view specific SQL projects.
